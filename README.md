## Ideas
* Social media exacerbates mental health problems and allows us to start comparing ourselves to more exciting life appeared on screens. The world needs help taking a mental break to help their mental health. During this pandamic we are highly Addicted to this .The Main Idea is to block these Social Networking sites for a span of Time and whenever we try to open these it suggest some healthy Alternatives.We are desparately in need of an app to force us to stop spending so much time in one of the most toxic places on our mental Health.
- Solution Either it should Allow us to write our Own Journals and blogs and if do not know where to start it provides some samples too.


* App connects 2 matching people based on their mental Status and related issues.Once your account is created you are sent to the home screen and entered into a pool of individuals looking for someone to talk to. When Alone Together has found someone with matching mental health issues you are connected to that person and forwarded to a chat room. In this chat room there is video-chat and text-chat feature using Webrtc and Peerjs

* Aim to take input from the user how is he feeling and output an affirmation or words of encouragement. For this feature we will use Google Cloud Natural Language REST API to analyze a users submitted feelings and determine the sentiment of their submission. The GCN lang REST API basically sorts whether the input is positive or negative an drest api then sends back positive Thoughts if the input is -ve.
